# **Measuring the worls**

**12/03/2023**

This week course was a very interesting. We discusses what data is, understanding who owns it and who can access it. Throughout the course, we were introduced to various methods of comprehending data as information, including the visualization of data in a visible and tangible manner. We discovered that data and maps serve as tools for measuring and understanding the world around us, making even the simplest data a powerful source of valuable information. The course also provided us with the skills to quickly collect, analyze, and interpret data while constantly questioning the why and potential implications of our actions.

What is data and what is information? What is the difference?

"Data is a collection of raw facts, figures, and statistics that are unorganized and have no context or meaning on their own. For example, a list of numbers or words on their own is just data.

Information, on the other hand, is the result of processing and organizing data in a way that gives it context, meaning, and relevance. It is the data that has been analyzed, interpreted, and presented in a way that allows for understanding and decision-making. For example, a graph or chart that displays trends or patterns is information.

In summary, data is raw and unprocessed, while information is data that has been processed, analyzed, and presented in a meaningful way." Chat GPT information. 

To learn about collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data, we were assigned to work in groups and choose a hypothesis and subject to measure.

In my group, I collaborated with Ramiro, Paige, June, and Marielle, and we decided to investigate whether the MDEF classroom impacts creativity, motivation, and overall health. We aimed to explore how the physical environment affects us through elements such as air quality, lighting, colors, furniture, and interior design. Throughout the project, we were introduced to various tools that could be used to measure different qualities. Our group utilized the Smart Citizen Kit to measure air quality, CO2 levels, light, particles, and noise. Using the Smart Citizen was an exciting experience as it was easy to set up and allowed us to observe the collected data in real-time, as well as explore other Smart Citizen data kits from around the world.
