# **Making sense and meaning** 

It might be hard to accept that humans have full responsibility for the current climate emergency and social imbalances, but we have designed all of it. Designing something is not just to define its aesthetics or proportions, neither is limited to objects. Design is about making decisions or provoking decisions of others. You either take your private car or public transport, both are decisions in which you are designing the way you are going to go from point A to point B. But beyond the trip from A to B, you are also designing how much are you going to pollute today, or if you do not have any other choice because you live in an American suburb, then your mode of transport has been decided already for you. Design is the attitude we have towards the simple things of everyday life, to the more transcendental ones that we believe transform our lives or other peopleâ€™s lives forever. The meaning and purpose in design are personal perceptions that translate into actions, but it also needs to be a collective effort in order to synchronize interventions at multiple scales that will allow the human species to inhabit and coexist on this planet with other forms of life, which are needed to sustain human life itself.

## Abstract 

The interconnectedness between people and their social and physical environments, as well as humanity and the earth, has been largely forgotten in our modern culture. We tend to view things in a linear way, consuming and disposing of them without considering the impact on our surroundings. Businesses prioritize profit and productivity, whereas nature operates on a cyclical basis. When something is discarded in nature, it is recycled and repurposed, contributing to the flourishing of other organisms. The natural world functions as a harmonious system, with every species playing a role in maintaining balance. The key to a sustainable future lies in reconciling our industrial society with the natural world, and recognizing the importance of both in achieving a harmonious coexistence.

Design has the potential to offer us more than just a functional and aesthetically pleasing product or environment. It can serve as a gateway to a broader perception of the world, connecting us to a larger reality. For a design to effectively resonate with us, it must meet several criteria. It must serve a specific purpose, evoke an emotional response, and align with our cultural style. By meeting these standards, a design can become an extension of our identity. However, it is also essential that a design is rooted in a belief system that we can identify with and has a purpose that we can empathize with to connect us effectively with the rest of the world. Whether it is urban design, product design, or the design of our own lives, design can serve as a bridge to a more profound connection with ourselves and the world around us.

On the other hand, it is possible to create a different kind of system that prioritizes the well-being of both people and the planet. This involves designing goods, urban landscapes, and processes with a purpose that benefits the many rather than the few. By including notions such as function, emotion, culture, and belief, design can become a transformational force that not only benefits the present but also future generations. The challenge is to develop a new belief system that recognizes the interconnectedness of all living things and prioritizes sustainability and social justice. If we can create a new design paradigm that aligns with these values, we may be able to build a more just and equitable society that works in harmony with the natural world.

## The impact of modern design. 

As humans, we have made tremendous technological advancements that have undoubtedly made our lives easier and more comfortable. However, we often fail to consider the potential negative consequences of our actions. 

One of the most significant negative impacts of modern design is the overconsumption of resources. Modern design often encourages consumerism and a culture of disposable products, which leads to the overproduction of goods and the depletion of natural resources. The trend towards fast fashion, for example, results in the production of large amounts of clothing that are often discarded after a few uses, contributing to the overconsumption of materials and energy.

Furthermore, modern design often leads to the creation of waste. The production of modern design products often involves the use of non-renewable resources, high energy consumption, and the generation of waste and pollution. The use of synthetic materials and chemicals in modern design can also lead to environmental harm, such as water and air pollution and the destruction of ecosystems.

Moreover, modern design can contribute to the loss of cultural and historical heritage. The widespread availability of modern design products and the prevalence of social media has created a globalized design language that often disregards local traditions and cultural context. This can result in a loss of cultural identity and a sense of place, as well as the erosion of traditional crafts and skills that have been passed down from generation to generation.

## Design as a tool of change.

One may contend that designing for sustainability presents a paradox, as the very act of creating goods often involves depleting natural resources that we strive to conserve. Thus, designers must adopt a reverse approach, carefully considering how to achieve the desired outcome using locally sourced, renewable, recycled, or biodegradable materials. Equally important is minimizing waste by implementing practices like reusability and upcycling. Design plays a crucial role in imbuing objects fashioned from limited resources with significance and value. Whether tackling urbanisation, renewable energy, or waste reduction, designers are at the forefront of driving change.

Design for sustainability involves an approach to activities that prioritizes the well-being of both people and the environment as the ultimate objective. It involves creating products and methods that are resource-efficient and use environmentally friendly materials. Often referred to as lifecycle design, this method considers a product's entire lifespan, including its impact on living beings and the environment. The growing consumer and industry focus on sustainability has popularized the design for sustainability approach, particularly for new product and process development.

While contemporary designers strive to prioritize sustainability in their work, it's crucial to acknowledge that our predecessors were more likely to follow trends and established design schools of thought than to prioritize ecological concerns. Today, we benefit from years of research into materials and processes that have made sustainable practices more accessible. These practices have expanded beyond design into other areas of an organization, where consideration for the entire product lifecycle was previously absent

## Conclusion

The field of design presents a powerful opportunity to enact meaningful change in the world. By prioritizing sustainability and social welfare, designers can create solutions that not only benefit local communities but can also be scaled up to have a global impact. As design becomes more accessible thanks to the spread of information, locally developed innovations can contribute to the growing pool of knowledge that is shaping our collective future.

Through reflection on our past mistakes, both as an industry and as a society, designers have shifted their values to prioritize a harmonious relationship with the natural world and future generations. This means creating solutions that align with our belief systems and empathize with the needs of diverse communities. By incorporating a wide range of perspectives, we can ensure that everyone is represented and that we can grow and thrive together without sacrificing the wellbeing of our planet.
