# **Making sense and meaning** 

It might be hard to accept that humans have full responsibility for the current climate emergency and social imbalances, but we have designed all of it. Designing something is not just to define its aesthetics or proportions, neither is limited to objects. Design is about making decisions or provoking decisions of others. You either take your private car or public transport, both are decisions in which you are designing the way you are going to go from point A to point B. But beyond the trip from A to B, you are also designing how much are you going to pollute today, or if you do not have any other choice because you live in an American suburb, then your mode of transport has been decided already for you. Design is the attitude we have towards the simple things of everyday life, to the more transcendental ones that we believe transform our lives or other peopleâ€™s lives forever. The meaning and purpose in design are personal perceptions that translate into actions, but it also needs to be a collective effort in order to synchronize interventions at multiple scales that will allow the human species to inhabit and coexist on this planet with other forms of life, which are needed to sustain human life itself.

## Abstract 

The interconnectedness between people and their social and physical environments, as well as humanity and the earth, has been largely forgotten in our modern culture. We tend to view things in a linear way, consuming and disposing of them without considering the impact on our surroundings. Businesses prioritize profit and productivity, whereas nature operates on a cyclical basis. When something is discarded in nature, it is recycled and repurposed, contributing to the flourishing of other organisms. The natural world functions as a harmonious system, with every species playing a role in maintaining balance. The key to a sustainable future lies in reconciling our industrial society with the natural world, and recognizing the importance of both in achieving a harmonious coexistence.

Design has the potential to offer us more than just a functional and aesthetically pleasing product or environment. It can serve as a gateway to a broader perception of the world, connecting us to a larger reality. For a design to effectively resonate with us, it must meet several criteria. It must serve a specific purpose, evoke an emotional response, and align with our cultural style. By meeting these standards, a design can become an extension of our identity. However, it is also essential that a design is rooted in a belief system that we can identify with and has a purpose that we can empathize with to connect us effectively with the rest of the world. Whether it is urban design, product design, or the design of our own lives, design can serve as a bridge to a more profound connection with ourselves and the world around us.

On the other hand, it is possible to create a different kind of system that prioritizes the well-being of both people and the planet. This involves designing goods, urban landscapes, and processes with a purpose that benefits the many rather than the few. By including notions such as function, emotion, culture, and belief, design can become a transformational force that not only benefits the present but also future generations. The challenge is to develop a new belief system that recognizes the interconnectedness of all living things and prioritizes sustainability and social justice. If we can create a new design paradigm that aligns with these values, we may be able to build a more just and equitable society that works in harmony with the natural world.

## System of capitalism

The current capitalist system has had a significant impact on the planet. Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and the pursuit of profit, which has led to the exploitation of natural resources, the overproduction of goods, and the generation of waste and pollution.

One of the most significant impacts of capitalism on the planet is climate change. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities have increased greenhouse gas emissions, causing a rise in global temperatures and the resulting impacts, including more frequent natural disasters, rising sea levels, and the extinction of plant and animal species.

Furthermore, the capitalist system has led to the overconsumption of resources and the creation of waste. The capitalist economy is based on the constant expansion of production and consumption, which leads to the generation of large amounts of waste and the depletion of natural resources. 

Capitalism has also had a negative impact on environmental justice. The pursuit of profit often leads corporations to prioritize their interests over the health and wellbeing of local communities, particularly marginalized communities who are disproportionately affected by environmental pollution and climate change. The exploitation of natural resources in developing countries and the dumping of waste in poor communities are examples of how the capitalist system perpetuates environmental inequality.

Moreover, the capitalist system has led to the privatization of natural resources, including water, land, and forests. This privatization has led to the exploitation of these resources for profit, often at the expense of local communities who rely on them for their livelihoods. The privatization of water, for example, has led to the unequal distribution of this vital resource, with corporations often having more access to it than local communities.

Another negative impact of capitalism on the planet is the erosion of biodiversity. The pursuit of profit often leads to the destruction of habitats and the exploitation of natural resources, which has resulted in the extinction of many plant and animal species. The overfishing of the oceans, the destruction of rainforests, and the use of pesticides in agriculture are examples of how the capitalist system has contributed to the loss of biodiversity.

Finally, the capitalist system has led to a culture of individualism and consumerism. The pursuit of profit has led corporations to prioritize individual desires over collective needs, encouraging the consumption of goods and services that are often unnecessary and harmful to the environment. This culture of consumerism has led to the overconsumption of resources and the creation of waste, perpetuating the negative impact of the capitalist system on the planet.
