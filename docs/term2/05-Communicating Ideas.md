# **Communicating Ideas** 

## Purpose  Vision  Identity

### PURPOSE. Why I exist and what impact I whant to make. 

If I had to answer this  questions, it would be complicated. I think we all ask ourselves these questions to make sense of our lives; a purpose, an identity. I believe that in my case, the answer to this question evolves and changes over time and I wouldn't be able to give an exact and precise answer. However, there is currently something on my mind and that is the importance of showing ourselves as vulnerable to society. The importance of showing our feelings and emotions freely. The society we live in is an expert in masks and disguises. This gives rise to many psychological problems such as depression and not accepting who we are. This ability to show ourselves as we are, I believe, is very important for a future free of judgments where we can all show ourselves and express ourselves freely, without fear of being hurt or abandoned. In this way, I believe that my current purpose as an individual on this planet is to show myself as I am, without fear of what others may say, and thus perhaps help others to do the same.

Regarding my purpose as an industrial designer, I would like to have a positive impact on the environment.

I believe that these two purposes, in some way or another, could be related. Showing my work in an open and sincere way to raise awareness among people. 

### VISION. A picture in words about the future. 

I imagine a future where we stop consuming nature as a geological resource. A future where the concept of "waste" does not exist and creativity is used to re-evaluate what we currently consider as useless and not worthy. A future where expressing yourself in a vulnerable way is not synonymous with weakness but with strength.

### MISION. What I do and how. 

- Waste materials recirculation.
- Encourage participation.
- Increase awareness through social media in a honest and sincere way.
