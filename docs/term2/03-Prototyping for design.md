# **Prototyping for design** 

This section will be part of a weekly journal where Iâ€™ll be documenting what we are doing during the course Prototyping for Design. This will allow me to have a place to document everything I am learning, and in the future, if I wanted to use some of these tools, I can have a place where I can take a look.

## Electronics & coding  
**01/02/2023**

In this first class Victor has introduced us to the basic concepts of electronics and programming. We were reintroduced to Arduino receiving the first task of this session in which we have to create music with an ESP32 and a buzzer. 

To creating music with Arduino and buzzers we used a ESP32 microcontroller, a piezo buzzer that is an electronic component that can make sounds, a bread board and connection wires and pins which are then connected through Arduino IDE and code to make sounds. 

Even though this topic is difficult for me to work with, there are a lot of online tutorias to make it easy. For this exercise I follow the instructions of one of the examples I have found on the Internet, which explains step by step everything you should do.

 ## Digitalizing realities   
**02/02/2023** 

In this class we had a presentation about digital tools for 2D, 3D, parametric and generative deisgn. We started off by communally adding programs we have worked with in the past to a Miroboard. I have used 2D and 3D programs for modelling before such as Illustrator, Rhino, Solidworks, NX to create 3D and 2D models and files for digital manufacturing. Also, I saw so many interesting programs and other ways of working. 

In relation to the development of my future projects I am interested in using the following tools:

- Womp 3D: Womp is a 3D software company that makes it simple for users to bring their 3D ideas to life. Womp's support for social and collaboration features, which encourages users to learn from one another, improve their 3D design skills, and share their works. 

- Adobe Illustraitor: Adobe Illustrator (AI) is a vector graphics editor used for editing, among other things (illustration as a branch of digital art applied to technical illustration or graphic design, among others).

- Thingiverse: Thingiverse is a website dedicated to the sharing of user-created digital design files. Providing primarily free, open-source hardware designs licensed.  3D printers, laser cutters, milling machines and many other technologies can be used to physically create the files shared by the users on Thingiverse.

- Blender: is a cross-platform computer program, dedicated especially to modeling, lighting, rendering, animation and creation of three-dimensional graphics. Also digital composition using the node procedural technique, video editing, sculpture (includes dynamic topology) and digital painting.

- FlatFab: flatfab is software that helps you design and fabricate 3D objects. 3D printing in new-age materials is great for small complex objects, but prohibitive in time and money for anything bigger than your fist.
