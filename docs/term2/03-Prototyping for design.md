# **Prototyping for design** 

This section will be part of a weekly journal where Iâ€™ll be documenting what we are doing during the course Prototyping for Design. This will allow me to have a place to document everything I am learning, and in the future, if I wanted to use some of these tools, I can have a place where I can take a look.

## Electronics & coding  
**01/02/2023**

In this first class Victor has introduced us to the basic concepts of electronics and programming. We were reintroduced to Arduino receiving the first task of this session in which we have to create music with an ESP32 and a buzzer. 

To creating music with Arduino and buzzers we used a ESP32 microcontroller, a piezo buzzer that is an electronic component that can make sounds, a bread board and connection wires and pins which are then connected through Arduino IDE and code to make sounds. 

Even though this topic is difficult for me to work with, there are a lot of online tutorias to make it easy. For this exercise I follow the instructions of one of the examples I have found on the Internet, which explains step by step everything you should do.

 ## Digitalizing realities   
**02/02/2023** 

In this class we had a presentation about digital tools for 2D, 3D, parametric and generative deisgn. We started off by communally adding programs we have worked with in the past to a Miroboard. I have used 2D and 3D programs for modelling before such as Illustrator, Rhino, Solidworks, NX to create 3D and 2D models and files for digital manufacturing. Also, I saw so many interesting programs and other ways of working, as a Blender and Womp 3d.
