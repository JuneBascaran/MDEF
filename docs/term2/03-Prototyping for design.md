# **Prototyping for design** 

This section will be part of a weekly journal where Iâ€™ll be documenting what we are doing during the course Prototyping for Design. This will allow me to have a place to document everything I am learning, and in the future, if I wanted to use some of these tools, I can have a place where I can take a look.

## Electronics & coding  
**01/02/2023**

In this first class Victor has introduced us to the basic concepts of electronics and programming. 

**Task 1: Playing music with Arduino**
We were reintroduced to Arduino receiving the first task of this session in which we have to create music with an ESP32 and a buzzer. 

To creating music with Arduino and buzzers we used a ESP32 microcontroller, a piezo buzzer that is an electronic component that can make sounds, a bread board and connection wires and pins which are then connected through Arduino IDE and code to make sounds. 

Even though this topic is difficult for me to work with, there are a lot of online tutorias to make it easy. For this exercise I follow the instructions of one of the examples I have found on the Internet, which explains step by step everything you should do.

## Digitalizing realities   
**02/02/2023** 

In this class we had a presentation about digital tools for 2D, 3D, parametric and generative deisgn. We started off by communally adding programs we have worked with in the past to a Miroboard. I have used 2D and 3D programs for modelling before such as Illustrator, Rhino, Solidworks, NX, Cinema 4D to create 3D and 2D models and files for digital manufacturing. Also, I saw so many interesting programs and other ways of working. 

In relation to the development of my future projects I am interested in using the following tools:

- Womp 3D: Womp is a 3D software company that makes it simple for users to bring their 3D ideas to life. Womp's support for social and collaboration features, which encourages users to learn from one another, improve their 3D design skills, and share their works. 

- Adobe Illustraitor: Adobe Illustrator (AI) is a vector graphics editor used for editing, among other things (illustration as a branch of digital art applied to technical illustration or graphic design, among others).

- Thingiverse: Thingiverse is a website dedicated to the sharing of user-created digital design files. Providing primarily free, open-source hardware designs licensed.  3D printers, laser cutters, milling machines and many other technologies can be used to physically create the files shared by the users on Thingiverse.

- Blender: is a cross-platform computer program, dedicated especially to modeling, lighting, rendering, animation and creation of three-dimensional graphics. Also digital composition using the node procedural technique, video editing, sculpture (includes dynamic topology) and digital painting.

- FlatFab: flatfab is software that helps you design and fabricate 3D objects. 3D printing in new-age materials is great for small complex objects, but prohibitive in time and money for anything bigger than your fist.

As an exercise, during the presentation, we had to represent a croassant in a parametrical way. We could draw it by hand, digitally or directly on Miro. I drew it by hand quickly without thinking too much.

**Task 2: Testing with Blender**
For the exercise of this class we must use one of these tools presented to put into practice. I chose Blender because I have never used it and because there are a variety of options to create the object, such as, lighting, rendering, animation and creation of three-dimensional graphics.

I have used an internet tutor to guide me step by step and I have realized that all the tools I have used in my past, such as Cinema 4D, are very similar but different at the same time. Each uses a different language and learning a new language is usually not easy at first. 

I really liked the program but I still have to put it into practice more to get better results.

## 2D Fabrication   
**08/02/2023** 

This week we have been introduced to the laser cutter. In my past I had already used it but this session has been good for me to refresh my knowledge.In the image shown below was my first object that I created with the laser cutter, allowing to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the class.

**Benefits of Laser cutting for prototyping**

This tool offer a high level of precision, accuracy and speed, making it possible to quickly create complex shapes and designs with ease. 

One of the main benefits of using a laser cutter for prototyping is the ability to quickly produce accurate and high-quality prototypes. With a laser cutter, it is possible to create intricate designs and shapes with precise dimensions and clean edges, which can greatly improve the overall quality of the final product.

Another advantage of using a laser cutter for prototyping is the ability to work with a wide range of materials. From wood and acrylic to metals and textiles, laser cutters can work with a wide range of materials, making it possible to produce prototypes that closely resemble the final product.

**Task 3: Using the lasercut**
To put theory into practice we were to use a method to Laser cut something. Currently, I am in a project where we are experimenting with biomaterials. I have taken this opportunity to create molds for the development of this project. 

Next, I show step by step the process for the creation of these molds with the laser cutter.

## Inputs & outputs   
**09/02/2023** 

The second part of the week we learned about inputs and outputs, looking at different sensors, what they can do and how. 

Sensors play a critical role in a wide range of applications and are essential for many modern technologies. For example, automation, robotics, healthcare, environmental monitoring or smart homes. They are used to gather data about the physical world and convert that information into electrical signals that can be processed and analyzed by computer systems. 

**Task 4: Testing sensors with Arduino**
As an excercise we tryed to use a sensor and actuator to comunicate, using a simple Light Dependant Resistor (LDR) and a LED. To perform this exercise more easily, we did it in parts. First, we tried turning on the LED with a button. To do this, we use a code provided by Arduino IDE, in which, you only have to change the number of the Pin.

After this part worked, we tested the LDR with another board. Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) acts as a light sensor that can detect changes in light intensity and adjust the circuit accordingly.

# **MICROCHALLENGE I**
**14/02/2023 - 17/02/2023**

You can find more information about the proyect by tapping here:

For this first challenge, I teamed up with Paige and Sami since we are in the same proyect and all three of us are interested in experimenting with biomaterials. The goals for this Challenge were to apply the things learnt during the past weeks in Prototyping for design: electronics and couding, 2D and 3D modelling, laser-cut and vinyl cut. 

After experimenting with many materials, we realized that we needed to develop molds for our future projects. We took this opportunity to develop a bio presser that would allow us to shape the final product. To do this, we defined the following variables: a low-tech bio presser for non-sticky biomaterials, interchangeable molds, and consistent pressure.

The most challenging part of this bio presser was making it interchangeable with other molds so that we could shape the material in different ways. Our plan then was to create a flatter mold that could produce three simple, blob-like modular plates.

We started the project by brainstorming ideas and drawing sketches. At first, we thought that developing this project would be easy, but soon we realized that it was more complicated than we expected. It was important to consider many variables, such as ventilation holes, the mold material, and the shape of the plates.

We modeled the mold using Illustrator and Rhino software so that we could cut it using a laser cutter.
