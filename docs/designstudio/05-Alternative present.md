## Term III-Updated Alternative present. 
For this updated alternative present I want to reflect on my new values for my proyects and the role I would like to have it. In this way, I have committed to following the values of distributed design, which means that I am applying an **open source** approach in my projects and working **collaboratively** with both participants and non-participants in the design process.

Additionally, I have also committed to continuing to work with communities and organizations to achieve greater social cohesion and a greater sense of community belonging. I firmly believe that these collaborations are crucial to ensuring that my projects are **inclusive** and meet the needs of all stakeholders.

On the other hand, my new role as a designer is not only to create innovative and impactful solutions, but also to raise awareness about the issues we face today. Also, I want to be a facilitator between communities, participants, and stakeholders to ensure that everyone's voice is heard and that their needs are met.
