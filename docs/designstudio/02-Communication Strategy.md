# **Communication Strategy**
## Roles and mediums of communication
According to my exploration interests, the roles and mediums that best suits with my design space are:

**Role 1** : Being transparent about your intentions, offering a space where people you are trying to reach and connect can understand better your background, your values, your commitment, your motives, your positionality – creating a foundation for trust.
**Medium 1**  Instagram account.

The first role is born from the motivation to approach people or entities that work with the topics of my interest, showing openly and transparently the small advances that I make during the master. The medium of communication used is an instagram account where the images will show my interests, values, motivations and positioning are attached.


**Role 2**: Sharing participants’ observations, reflections and experiences during and after our interventions. 
**Medium 2**: Showing my work space to others.

This last role refers to using art and materials as a mediator to increase awareness of the environmental problems in which we live and the footprint that human beings generate. To do this, viewers will visit my workplace to observe, reflect and experiment with the works I make.
