# **Radical Situadness**
(27/02/2023) 

Currently, I am doing an intervention with a group that cleans beaches, called Clean Beach Initiative. During this first intervention, where I was collecting waste from the beach, I reflected on something that was happening in my subconscious, something that came from my past traumas or from the way this system has forced me to see things.

What happened was that my mind, unconsciously, wanted to compete with my other colleagues, wanting to collect more waste from the beach than others. This made me reflect. At that moment, when I started comparing myself to others and trying to be the best at collecting, I forgot the main reason why I was there, why we were all there. I forgot that I was there out of love and respect for the sea.

I think this desire to compete and want to be the best has been imposed on me since I was born; my parents, my environment, the system, etc. Instead of helping each other to protect and care for the planet, our ego is limited to standing out and competing. In conclusion to this reflection, I believe that if we want to take care of and have a positive impact on the planet, we must do it out of love, working from a higher dimensional perspective, such as empathy, compassion, care, and understanding.

Changing these habits of comparing myself to others is something I want to work on. Unlearning to relearn. I also believe that this tendency to compare myself should also be applied to my personal life. I am not better or worse than anyone else; I have my own way of shining, and that is what makes me unique.

This reflection leads me to question the following:

Where does this tendency to compete come from? Where do its roots lie?
Why does the current system prefer us to compete instead of cooperate?
