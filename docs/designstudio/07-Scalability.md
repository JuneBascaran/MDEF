## Stakeholders map

I have developed this map to provide stakeholders of our project "Future Cravings" with a visual representation, aiming to explore potential avenues of growth in relation to the actors involved. In summary, our upcoming projects will enable us to enhance our communication strategy and expand our audience. By engaging in strategic partnerships, we can leverage shared resources, knowledge, and expertise to foster the development and expansion of our project. Such collaborations will not only enhance our communication strategy and broaden our audience but also enable us to tap into new markets, access additional funding opportunities, and benefit from synergies that arise from working collectively towards a common objective. Through these collaborative efforts, we aim to accelerate the growth and impact of our project, while also contributing to the advancement of the broader field in which we operate.

## Designing Future Craving out

Regarding Future Cravings, we have two projects planned: Future Cravings x Posidonia in Ibiza and Future Cravings x Forest in Barcelona. However, next year my team won’t be staying in Barcelona, and we won’t be able to work together as we have done this year. Nevertheless, this will allow us to work remotely and perhaps in other parts of the world. This is an advantage as it helps us expand our audience and gain fresh perspectives from people with diverse backgrounds.

Distributing our work in different locations around the world offers several benefits. Firstly, it allows us to tap into the cultural diversity and unique perspectives that each region can provide. By collaborating with individuals from various countries, we can access a wide range of ideas and innovative solutions. Moreover, this geographical distribution presents opportunities for international networking and collaborations, broadening our professional connections and enhancing our growth potential.

Currently, we are focused on strengthening the communication of our project through the implementation of strategies on our social media platforms, such as launching our Instagram profile and creating our website. We recognize that effective communication is crucial to gaining visibility and generating interest in our initiative.

Furthermore, we have understood the importance of collaborating with other organizations as a powerful tool to enhance our project. Recently, we had the privilege of collaborating with Garage Stories and Corpen at our latest event, which provided us with an invaluable opportunity to expand our audience and increase our reach. Through this collaboration, we were able to leverage the networks and expertise of these organizations to reach a wider public and make a significant impact. By establishing strategic partnerships, we can share knowledge, exchange ideas, and create synergies that strengthen the effectiveness and scope of our project.

## Designing my self out

I would like to continue learning and exploring with biomaterials, and perhaps in the future, I can work in this field. I plan to visit the Basque Biodesign Center this summer with the goal of making contacts in the Basque Country and meeting people who are also working in this field. On the other hand, I am looking for a job that aligns with my values and interests, specifically related to sustainability and materials, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the real-world context of these topics and to gain experience in a work environment.

My plan is to stay in Barcelona for another year since this experience has been very beneficial for me personally and professionally. However, I would like to return to my hometown and create my own work environment as a sustainable materials analyst and developer.
