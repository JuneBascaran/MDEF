# WHAT´S MY FIGHT?

As an industrial designer I would like to contribute to improving the environmental impact generated by industries and the current uncontrolled consumption.

The union of different disciplines, such as design with biology or material science, will bring with it new innovative and sustainable solutions that could benefit both nature and humans.

Is time to act and it is in our hands to make this world a better place.
