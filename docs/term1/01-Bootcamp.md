# WHAT´S MY FIGHT?

As an industrial designer I would like to contribute to improving the environmental impact generated by industries and the current uncontrolled consumption.

## WHY?

It all started in the first industrial revolution, where factories began to increase production. In this way, the price of the products decreased and thus, a greater population was able to acquire those products, improving people´s quality of live. 
But what is about the environment? 
The toxic gases emitted by the factories have generated global warming, and consequently, climate change.  This environmental impact brings with it serious environmental problems, such as rising temperatures, floods, the loss of biodiversity or more poverty and inequality.

## HOW?
The path towards a sustainable or even a regenerative future will demand that we abandon our current linear, extractive, and often toxic practices and remplance them with bio-based and renewable materials and circular methods. Design with bio-based and biomaterials can offer a host of benefits both for the nature and humans. 

A shift towards regenerative bio-based practices offers us a new mean to design sustainably and a framework for a deeper understanding and clearer awareness of the critical balance between our demand for things and the ecosystemic health of terretrial soils, water, and biological communities with whom we share our planet. 

Is time to act and it is in our hands to make this world a better place.
