# Living With Our Own Ideas
## Reflection

### **What did I make?**
### **What happens when I involve myself?**
### **What happens when I use myself us an instrument?**
### **Did anything change about my way of working?**
### **What does it mean for my future work?**
### **After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change my understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration?**
