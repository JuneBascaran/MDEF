# Living With Our Own Ideas


## Reflections

When you involve your self in the process of exploration and research you realize many more details than when you perform externally. One of the conclusions I have drawn through this challege is that by involving yourself in the exploration process you are able to more easily detect emotions and feelings, which you previously took for granted. It's a way to empathize more accurately.

In my past projects these kinds of first-person implications have not been realized. These investigations were carried out through questionnaires, interviews, observations, etc. Many of the questions questioned were taken for granted. But once you get involved, new questions arise that wouldn't otherwise arise. New opportunities for intervention. 

For my future implications as 1PP (First Person Perspective) I would like to focus more on concepts such as understanding nature or understanding the emotions generated by one material or another in people, etc.
