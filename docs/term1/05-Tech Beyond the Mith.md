# Tech Beyond the Mith 

## Reflection
### Drip coffee maker disassembly 

**What do you learn?** 
* Companies of electrical devices induce customer fear to keep you unaware of the right to repair and citizen power.
* We live in an economic era of the Black box sydrome
* The design meets eletronics, physics, socio-economic reality to make this artifact. It is reflective of its time (10-15 years old)
* Smart materials is using material properties to our advantage as designers
* The 5Rs (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle) are aplicable to electrical devices/components, and these can still have market value


**What surprised you?**
* When we first saw the machine (big plastic case) we thought that the electrical components would occupy more space, it turns out it doesn't require so much plastic. Plastic is a medium to achieve a economic goal. It is a cheap material,disposable, easily sourced and profitable so companies do not care as they are money driven.
