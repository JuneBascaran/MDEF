# Tech Beyond the Mith 

These two weeks we have been exploring technology and everything that lies behind it. Thanks to this program has helped me understand that the current system in which we live is only motivated by economic reasons, sell and consume more. In this way, they create products that after a period of time, calculated in advance by the manufacturer or company, stop working and are irreparable. The electrical components are hidden inside a black box, apparently difficult to obtain and understand. Once this barrier is crossed you understand that the technology used to operate the machine is not as complicated as it seemed and even those electrical components could be used for other purposes or replaced by others without the need to buy a new product.
