# Extended Intelligences

**WEEK || 29/11 - 09/12**

In this two weeks, we had a seminar called "Extended Intelligences" led by Ramón Sangüesa, Lucas Peña and Taller Estampa. The objective of this seminar was to learn the basic concepts of AI and how it works. Also, learn through different tools the technology behind these complex machines.

During this sessions, we have been arguing about what intelligence is and how that has been transferred in the current machines. Proposing ethical questions such as, could a machine make decisions for us? What would happen if they did? could they take control of our lives? Also, they gave us information of how Artificial Intelligence works and the main parts that make it up: dataset, neural network and training. 

There exist different neural networks for many different functions. In this few weeks working with IA, we have been texting with Colab, a free cloud service hosted by Google to foster research on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, some neural networks based on image classification, object recognition, motion detector and others.
