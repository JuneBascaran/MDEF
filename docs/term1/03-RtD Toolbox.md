# **RtD Toolbox**
## Reflection of the prototyping roles

During my professional career as an industrial design engineer, the prototyping phase has not been carried out in most of the projects. According to the methodology used in the design projects, the prototyping phase is carried out after the analysis and research phases (market analysis, user analysis, concept research, state of the art...), conceptualization phase (ideation phase), product development (measurements, materials, 3D modeling, rendering...). Consequently, not much has been delved into the subject. 

The only time I have made prototypes has been to analyze and explore the ergonomics of the product. As a tool to identify future functional problems. Thus, of the 4 prototyping roles I have used **Role 1: Prototyping as an experimental component.**
