# **Atlas of Weak Signals**
## BOARD
![](../images/W2-AoWS/June (2).jpg)
## MAIN WEAK SIGNALS
**Inter-species collaboration:**
This card arises from the fear generated by current environmental problems and how it could affect our future and  of our projimos future. This card proposes to design collaboratively with nature, bringing us closer to a future where what is made by humans and the growth of nature becomes one. It is about stopping consuming nature as a geological resource to nourishing it as biological. 
 
From here arises my interest in new ecological materials or biomaterials that will improve the impact generated by current consumerism and also the communication between humans and nature as an emotional and artistic act through materials. 
 
*Questions to solve:* **How can humans collaborate with other species to create new materials without depleting natural resources?**
 
**Rural futures:**
My interest in this card comes from my roots, the place where I grew up, a small coastal town in the Basque Country. This place stands out for its history, culture and tradition. It is a land historically linked to txakoli (a type of Basque wine) and currently remains one of the municipalities with the largest number of wineries in Biscay. It is also a place attracted touristically by its beach and the surfing. 
 
I firmly believe that to generate a positive impact on our environment globally we must start with the resources we have and reflect on how they can be used.
 
Development for a rural future is for me an opportunity to start projects where the main objective is to unite the rural community to collaborate in the care and well-being of rural areas, activities where themes such as socialization, leisure, tradition and care for the environment predominate.
 
I imagine a rural future where urban centers, rural jobs, tourism and the green economy are revitalized. A place where new opportunities are provided through new technologies. A more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable rural future.  
 
 
**Craft and digital fabrications:**
 
The aim of this letter is to unite modern processes such as digital fabrication with artisanal manufacturing processes, reshaping innovation towards a new definition of slower manufacturing. Establishing a new aesthetic driven by sustainability, functionality and craft.
 
*Questions to solve:* **How can we switch to slowed processes to start producing to large scales?**

## AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY

- Reshape natural resources; explore raw materials.
- Materials have an active role in design, creating form and expression, not just fulfilling technical requirements.
- Empathize with other living species and be conscious of their life cycle.
- Encourage craft skills (gardening, ceramics, glass process).
- Solution that establish a connection with the natural environment.
- Committed with a sustainable cycle of the resources and process involved.
- Encourage rural jobs with digital fabrication.
