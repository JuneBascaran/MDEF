# Community Engagement

**WEEK || 21/11 - 26/11**

This week we were introduced to the collective Holon by Markel Cormenzana and Merce Rua. Holon is a design cooperative that sees a world in transition, helping organisations align their goals with the needs of people they serve and its social and environmental context. We learned about the development of the practice of design throughout the past century, and how it has evolved into what it is nowadays, focusing on strategic design intervening in the natural environment.
Shifted our perspective on how we assess challenges, where we need to evolve new ways of designing to be able to tackle with the kind of challenges reality is forcing upon us. Instead of solving a problem that will inevitably spring other problems.
