# Community Engagement

**WEEK || 21/11 - 26/11**

This week we were introduced to the collective Holon by Markel Cormenzana and Merce Rua. Holon is a design cooperative that sees a world in transition, helping organisations align their goals with the needs of people they serve and its social and environmental context. 

We learned about the development of the practice of design throughout the past century, and how it has evolved into what it is nowadays, focusing on strategic design intervening in the natural environment. The vision of design has changed and now the world is asking for a more collaborative ways of working, instead of more individualistic ways, which only attends to achieve personal future desires. This change will allow us to face the challenges that the new reality  is forcing upon us.

The last day, we lear to use our bodies as a design tool, creating live scultures by listening to what our bodies are trying to tell us without the influence of our minds, which always tries to judge and control our natural emotions.
