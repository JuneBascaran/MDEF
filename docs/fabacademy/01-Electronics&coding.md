# **Electronics & coding**

In this first class of prototyping for design Victor has introduced us to the basic concepts of electronics and programming. Even though this topic makes me somewhat heavy to understand and pay attention I think I can get to do very cool things with the use of these tools that facilitate the coding processtools, like Arduino.
