For the reflection tree I have chosen one of my projects from last semester to reflect on what I can improve. The project is about collecting microplastics from the beach with the Beach Clean Initiative. My group and I volunteered to clean the beaches and tested and developed different tools to collect microplastics from the sand.

### Learning skills 
With this exercise, I have used skills that have allowed me to self-evaluate on the different values of distributed design. Skills such as being able to view my project and interventions from a different perspective to see what I have done well and what I can improve. 
### Dynamics 
I was not able to do this reflection exercise collectively with my other group mates. Perhaps it would have been more dynamic if I had been able to share this evaluation jointly. I also believe that it would have been helpful to see different points of view and evaluate our project more effectively. Anyway, it has been interesting to evaluate the project in relation to the proposed values. Certain values that are not so present in the project can be identified, such as addressing social challenges.
