# **Prototyping for design** 

## ROBOTS    
**19/04/2023** 

In this first class of Prototyping for design in Term III, we started with the subject Robotics. In this class, we started learning about different kinds of robot arms that exist nowadays, the motors they use, the amount of axis they have, the end effectors one can use, and some techniques and applications commonly used such as 3D printing, milling, cutting and automation. I was particularly fascinated by the robots that they  printed ceramics in mid-air. Joseph then provided a concise tutorial on controlling a robot, utilizing a plugin called Robots, and shared several valuable tips and recommendations.
