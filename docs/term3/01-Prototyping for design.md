# **Prototyping for design** 

## ROBOTS    
**19/04/2023** 

In this first class of Prototyping for design in Term III, we started with the subject Robotics. In this class, we started learning about different kinds of robot arms that exist nowadays, the motors they use, the amount of axis they have, the end effectors one can use, and some techniques and applications commonly used such as 3D printing, milling, cutting and automation. I was particularly fascinated by the robots that they  printed ceramics in mid-air. Joseph then provided a concise tutorial on controlling a robot, utilizing a plugin called Robots, and shared several valuable tips and recommendations.

## BLENDER 
**20/04/2023**

In this class we learned the history of Blender, who was developed and we discuseed about why Bender is a good program for designers. We also learned about the important aspects to consider when choosing a modeling tool. It is essential to select a tool that allows for easy learning while also providing the freedom to accomplish desired outcomes. Acquiring proficiency with tools such as Blender provides the user with the autonomy to design with greater flexibility. Modifying the tool itsself should be a normal part of the creative process to allow a wider range of outputs. Blender is a versatile tool that can be used for a wide range of purposes, from creating visual effects for movies to designing products for 3D printing to developing virtual reality experiences.

## LIVE CODING AS A HUMAN INTERFACE 
**26/04/2023**

In this first class of the week, we had a class about Interfaces. Xavi Domingúez stars with a brief presentation of his professional backaground history. He showed us the evolutions of his projects and works through the time and how and why he ended in Fab Lab. Also, he showed us some useful and intuitive tools for interfaces, such us Scrach, Phthon, IFTTT and more. After Xavi´s presentation Citali Hernandez present some of her cool projects, which she use electronics as art. Especially, I was very struck by one of his projects where she used robots to simulate the movements of the human body, mixing the art of dance with electronics and programming. 

In the second part of the class, we test with Hydra, a video synthesizer and livecoding environment that works on top of the browser.

## MICROCHALLENGE III 

Sami Piercy · Josephine Bourghardt · June Bascaran 

For this last microchallenge we have been exploring and learning how to use AR tools to make a 2D poster interactive for the Future Cravings event. 

**CONCEPT**

Future Cravings is a methodology for climate action, using multi-sensory formats to ideate differently around climate issues. It is based on the original problem solving forum: the dinner table (or the fire pit depending on how far back you go) where the dinner experience combines visuals, sounds, storytelling and alternative materials prompting critical conversation.

The installation will be an interactive experience to illustrate visuals, sounds and artefacts within act of conversation and storytelling in a sensory experience to communicate the concept. To further visualise and communicate past and future dinner experiences posters will accompany the installation. To add an extra layer of communication we will create a series of interactive posters, using AR and 3D visuals to show the experience virtually. In doing so we can make our 2D posters engaging and playful.

**PROPOSAL**

2D posters that become interactive with the use of AR.

**LEARNING EXPERIENCE**

Learning to use software that allows you to create augmented reality visualizations is not as easy as we initially expected. It has taken us a lot of time to figure out which tools to use and how to use them. Learning to use a new program from scratch always takes time, and sometimes it can be a bit frustrating to grasp a new language. However, the abundance of tutorials and the intuitive design of the programs used have facilitated the process.

In my personal experience, I have greatly enjoyed learning a new program. Meta Spark Studio has allowed me to learn how to create filters for Instagram. It's something I have always been curious about, and finally, I understand the process behind it. It has also allowed me to easily create augmented reality visualizations, and I believe it is a very interesting tool for graphic visualization creation. I would like to learn more about creating interactive visualizations through virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).

**Why AR for this?**

Utilizing AR to craft communicative and promotional visualizations for events proves to be an exceptional approach in captivating participants' attention and immersing them in an innovative and indelible experience. Nonetheless, at Future Cravings, one of our primary objectives is to foster interpersonal dialogue without direct reliance on technology. We aspire to facilitate participant interaction that transcends the utilization of personal devices. However, AR distinguishes itself from conventional technologies by actively engaging users and encouraging collaboration among multiple participants.
