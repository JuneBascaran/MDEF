# **Prototyping for design** 

## ROBOTS    
**19/04/2023** 

In this first class of Prototyping for design in Term III, we started with the subject Robotics. In this class, we started learning about different kinds of robot arms that exist nowadays, the motors they use, the amount of axis they have, the end effectors one can use, and some techniques and applications commonly used such as 3D printing, milling, cutting and automation. I was particularly fascinated by the robots that they  printed ceramics in mid-air. Joseph then provided a concise tutorial on controlling a robot, utilizing a plugin called Robots, and shared several valuable tips and recommendations.

## LIVE CODING AS A HUMAN INTERFACE 

**26/04/2023**
In this first class of the week, we had a class about Interfaces. Xavi Domingúez stars with a brief presentation of his professional backaground history. He showed us the evolutions of his projects and works through the time and how and why he ended in Fab Lab. Also, he showed us some useful and intuitive tools for interfaces, such us Scrach, Phthon, IFTTT and more. After Xavi´s presentation Citali Hernandez present some of her cool projects, which she use electronics as art. Especially, I was very struck by one of his projects where she used robots to simulate the movements of the human body, mixing the art of dance with electronics and programming. 

In the second part of the class, we test with Hydra, a video synthesizer and livecoding environment that works on top of the browser.
