I am an Industrial Design Engineer from Basque Country with a focus on circular design. My new values as a designer include following the principles of distributed design, applying open-source code, promoting inclusivity of participants and non-participants in the design process, and collaborating with communities and organizations for greater social cohesion and a sense of belonging. As a designer, my new role involves increasing awareness of current issues and being a facilitator between communities, participants, etc. Additionally, I am currently interested in exploring regenerative materials and finding new solutions to hack the supply chain through the recirculation of materials. 

**If I had to say it briefly** : Circular design engineer
