 I am an Industrial Design Engineer from Basque Country with a focus on circular design. I am passionate about redesigning habits and creating value for the objects and materials we use, to encourage conservation, trade, repair, and recycling. Also, I have interest to explore regenerative materials, which involves designing materials that not only minimize environmental harm but also contribute to the regeneration of ecosystems.
