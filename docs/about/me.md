# About me

Industrial design engineer with the ambition to design with and for nature.

I was born and raised in a small coastal village in the Basque Country, surrounded by mountains and the sea. Since childhood I have had a strong connection with nature and this has led me to make my profession based on it. 

Therefore, in this master I would like to explore the different paths that can lead me to what I really want to do, always with my aim well focused: designing with and for nature.
