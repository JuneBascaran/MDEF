 Industrial Design Engineer from Basque Country who is passionate about designing for a more sustainable and respectful future with nature. My work revolves around exploring materials and finding eco-friendly solutions for industrial design. I am particularly interested in regenerative design, which involves designing products that not only minimize environmental harm but also contribute to the regeneration of ecosystems. My vision is to create products that not only function well but also promote environmental consciousness and contribute to the regeneration of the planet.
