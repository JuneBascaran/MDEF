WHY? \u00b6 It all started in the first industrial revolution, where factories began to increase production. In this way, the price of the products decreased and thus, a greater population was able to acquire those products, improving people\u00b4s quality of live. But what is about the environment? The toxic gases emitted by the factories have generated global warming, and consequently, climate change. This environmental impact brings with it serious environmental problems, such as rising temperatures, floods, the loss of biodiversity or more poverty and inequality. HOW? \u00b6 The path towards a sustainable or even a regenerative future will demand that we abandon our current linear, extractive, and often toxic practices and remplance them with bio-based and renewable materials and circular methods. Design with bio-based and biomaterials can offer a host of benefits both for the nature and humans. A shift towards regenerative bio-based practices offers us a new mean to design sustainably and a framework for a deeper understanding and clearer awareness of the critical balance between our demand for things and the ecosystemic health of terretrial soils, water, and biological communities with whom we share our planet. Is time to act and it is in our hands to make this world a better place.

This card proposes to design collaboratively with nature, bringing us closer to a future where what is made by humans and the growth of nature becomes one. It is about stopping consuming nature as a geological resource to nourishing it as biological. From here arises my interest in new ecological materials or biomaterials that will improve the impact generated by current consumerism and also the communication between humans and nature as an emotional and artistic act through materials. Questions to solve: How can humans collaborate with other species to create new materials without depleting natural resources? Rural futures: My interest in this card comes from my roots, the place where I grew up, a small coastal town in the Basque Country. This place stands out for its history, culture and tradition. It is a land historically linked to txakoli (a type of Basque wine) and currently remains one of the municipalities with the largest number of wineries in Biscay. It is also a place attracted touristically by its beach and the surfing. I firmly believe that to generate a positive impact on our environment globally we must start with the resources we have and reflect on how they can be used. Development for a rural future is for me an opportunity to start projects where the main objective is to unite the rural community to collaborate in the care and well-being of rural areas, activities where themes such as socialization, leisure, tradition and care for the environment predominate. I imagine a rural future where urban centers, rural jobs, tourism and the green economy are revitalized. A place where new opportunities are provided through new technologies. A more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable rural future. Craft and digital fabrications: The aim of this letter is to unite modern processes such as digital fabrication with artisanal manufacturing processes, reshaping innovation towards a new definition of slower manufacturing. Establishing a new aesthetic driven by sustainability, functionality and craft. Questions to solve: How can we switch to slowed processes to start producing to large scales? AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY \u00b6 Reshape natural resources; explore raw materials. Materials have an active role in design, creating form and expression, not just fulfilling technical requirements. Empathize with other living species and be conscious of their life cycle. Encourage craft skills (gardening, ceramics, glass process). Solution that establish a connection with the natural environment. Committed with a sustainable cycle of the resources and process involved. Encourage rural jobs with digital fabrication.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#board","text":"","title":"BOARD"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#main-weak-signals","text":"Inter-species collaboration: This card arises from the fear generated by current environmental problems and how it could affect our future and of our projimos future.

According to the methodology used in the design projects, the prototyping phase is carried out after the analysis and research phases (market analysis, user analysis, concept research, state of the art\u2026), conceptualization phase (ideation phase), product development (measurements, materials, 3D modeling, rendering\u2026). Consequently, not much has been delved into the subject. The only time I have made prototypes has been to analyze and explore the ergonomics of the product. As a tool to identify future functional problems. Thus, of the 4 prototyping roles I have used Role 1: Prototyping as an experimental component. As for the question of what prototyping role I would like to use in relation to my fight, my vision and my desire for professional identity, I am interested in using Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry , as a tool of empathy and Role 4: The prototyping process as a research vehicle . The latter could be a good method for the research and development of new sustainable materials, where the main objective is to analyze and explore how the product is crafted. In addition to these two Roles, I would also like to explore more in Role 1 , which I firmly believe that is a fundamental method for any product with a good aesthetic and functional design. Map of my resources \u00b6 The aim of this map is to understand what I have around that can be used in my design process. Being aware of this will allow me to know what I am capable of doing.","title":"RtD Toolbox"},{"location":"term1/03-RtD%20Toolbox/#rtd-toolbox","text":"","title":"RtD Toolbox"},{"location":"term1/03-RtD%20Toolbox/#reflection-about-the-prototyping-roles","text":"During my professional career as an industrial design engineer, the prototyping phase has not been carried out in most of the projects.
