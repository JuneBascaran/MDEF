According to the methodology used in the design projects, the prototyping phase is carried out after the analysis and research phases (market analysis, user analysis, concept research, state of the art\u2026), conceptualization phase (ideation phase), product development (measurements, materials, 3D modeling, rendering\u2026). Consequently, not much has been delved into the subject. The only time I have made prototypes has been to analyze and explore the ergonomics of the product. As a tool to identify future functional problems. Thus, I have used Role 1: Prototype as a experimental component As for the question of what prototyping role I would like to use in relation to my fight, my vision and my desire for professional identity, I am interested in using Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry , as a tool of empathy and Role 4: The prototyping process as a research vehicle . The latter could be a good method for the research and development of new sustainable materials, where the main objective is to analyze and explore how the product is crafted. In addition to these two Roles, I would also like to explore more in Role 1 , which I firmly believe that is a fundamental method for any product with a good aesthetic and functional design.

A journey where I have planted seeds in topics that I have always had interest in. A journey where I have learned that many times the best way to get out mental kaos and fear is by doing. Coming out of a professional past where I worked hours and hours between four walls, this first experience in the master\u2019s has allowed me to understand that design is much more than creating aesthetic, ergonomic and marketable products. It has helped me to face the professional reality in a more solidary way, leaving my comfort zone and collaborating with communities in the city. After this first intervention I have understood that part of the current problem of consumerism is based on the perception that people have with the objects they use in their day to day. A psychological, cultural, or social behavior in which affection and value about the things around us has been lost. If we look back and analyze the behavior that our ancestors had with their goods, we can highlight that they had other perceptions about the value of things. When something didn\u2019t work, they fixed it or reused it for other functions. Currently, we live in a system where we are continuously driven to buy, without even stopping to think if we really need it.

During this first intervention, where I was collecting waste from the beach, I reflected on something that was happening in my subconscious, something that came from my past traumas or from the way this system has forced me to see things. What happened was that my mind, unconsciously, wanted to compete with my other colleagues, wanting to collect more waste from the beach than others. This made me reflect. At that moment, when I started comparing myself to others and trying to be the best at collecting, I forgot the main reason why I was there, why we were all there. I forgot that I was there out of love and respect for the sea. I think this desire to compete and want to be the best has been imposed on me since I was born; my parents, my environment, the system, etc. Instead of helping each other to protect and care for the planet, our ego is limited to standing out and competing. In conclusion to this reflection, I believe that if we want to take care of and have a positive impact on the planet, we must do it out of love, working from a higher dimensional perspective, such as empathy, compassion, care, and understanding. Changing these habits of comparing myself to others is something I want to work on. Unlearning to relearn. I also believe that this tendency to compare myself should also be applied to my personal life. I am not better or worse than anyone else; I have my own way of shining, and that is what makes me unique. This reflection leads me to question the following: Where does this tendency to compete come from? Where do its roots lie? Why does the current system prefer us to compete instead of cooperate?","title":"Radical Situadness"},{"location":"designstudio/04-Radical%20Situadness/#radical-situadness","text":"(27/02/2023) Currently, I am doing an intervention with a group that cleans beaches, called Clean Beach Initiative.

It offers a wide assortment of varieties with different shapes and colors, but the taste has changed. The tomato no longer tastes like tomato. This is due to a change in the genetics of the fruit, which has been modified to increase the productivity of the plant (size and quantity of the fruit) and not to increase or improve the taste of the tomato. But, how is the genetics of a tomato manipulated? This process is carried out by modifying the structure of the DNA contained in the cells of the organism, copying, deleting, inserting or moving long sequences from one point to another in the genome (total sequence of DNA possessed by a particular organism). To increase the size of the tomato, copies of the gene that determines the size of the fruit are increased. In this way, the production of the same is increased. And, how can the original taste be returned to the tomato? Several studies have identified a genetic code responsible for 13 chemical compounds associated with flavor, which abound in ancestral tomato varieties. Using a new technique called CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) you can cut (ctrl X) and paste (ctrl V) various DNA sequences so that the tomato grows with the genetic properties of ancestral tomatoes.

Plants are feeding soil microorganisms carbon, and the soil microorganisms are bringing plants mineral nutrients. In the process of all that, those soil microorganisms make a carbon glue out of that carbon fuel and they make habitat in the soil. They make little pockets in the soil to control the flow of air and water. That\u2019s one of the ways that carbon gets fixed in the soil. In other words, soil has the unique ability to sequester carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Soil, plants and climate are connected. If we don\u2019t have a living plant, we\u2019re going to have more evaporation.

Personally, I was very interested in the project \u201cBe grounded\u201d. A project that proposes to improve the relationship between humans and nature through materials, using an emotional and artistic language. Also, I liked all those projects that use food waste, especially the \u201cEn(des)uso\u201d project, which proposes various solutions to what we have always considered useless and invalid. I have to say that I was already aware of some of the projects presented, thanks to the intervention I made in Term 1 on food waste. Then, Lara briefly presented the history of materials and how they have influenced each era of the evolution of human beings, allowing us to improve our quality of life. Also, we contextualize the current problem of using materials as unlimited resources and the impact this is generating on the biosphere. On the other hand, he also emphasized that materials are more than their functionality and properties, they can also serve as tools to convey emotions, feelings and sensations. Proposing to the designers to select the materials to generate an interactive and sensory experience in the users. This area of exploration is of great interest to me. In my opinion, I think that there is currently a lack of value and affection for the materials that surround us, and therefore for the artifacts we use in our day. I firmly believe that materials can improve that relationship between people and objects. I also believe that the implementation of materials adding emotional values can help improve the life cycle of products, and consequently, the impact they have on the environment.

This will allow me to have a place to document everything I am learning, and in the future, if I wanted to use some of these tools, I can have a place where I can take a look. Electronics & coding \u00b6 01/02/2023 In this first class Victor has introduced us to the basic concepts of electronics and programming. Task 1: Playing music with Arduino We were reintroduced to Arduino receiving the first task of this session in which we have to create music with an ESP32 and a buzzer. To creating music with Arduino and buzzers we used a ESP32 microcontroller, a piezo buzzer that is an electronic component that can make sounds, a bread board and connection wires and pins which are then connected through Arduino IDE and code to make sounds. Even though this topic is difficult for me to work with, there are a lot of online tutorias to make it easy. For this exercise I follow the instructions of one of the examples I have found on the Internet, which explains step by step everything you should do. Digitalizing realities \u00b6 02/02/2023 In this class we had a presentation about digital tools for 2D, 3D, parametric and generative deisgn. We started off by communally adding programs we have worked with in the past to a Miroboard. I have used 2D and 3D programs for modelling before such as Illustrator, Rhino, Solidworks, NX, Cinema 4D to create 3D and 2D models and files for digital manufacturing. Also, I saw so many interesting programs and other ways of working. In relation to the development of my future projects I am interested in using the following tools: Womp 3D: Womp is a 3D software company that makes it simple for users to bring their 3D ideas to life. Womp\u2019s support for social and collaboration features, which encourages users to learn from one another, improve their 3D design skills, and share their works. Adobe Illustraitor: Adobe Illustrator (AI) is a vector graphics editor used for editing, among other things (illustration as a branch of digital art applied to technical illustration or graphic design, among others). Thingiverse: Thingiverse is a website dedicated to the sharing of user-created digital design files. Providing primarily free, open-source hardware designs licensed. 3D printers, laser cutters, milling machines and many other technologies can be used to physically create the files shared by the users on Thingiverse. Blender: is a cross-platform computer program, dedicated especially to modeling, lighting, rendering, animation and creation of three-dimensional graphics. Also digital composition using the node procedural technique, video editing, sculpture (includes dynamic topology) and digital painting. FlatFab: flatfab is software that helps you design and fabricate 3D objects. 3D printing in new-age materials is great for small complex objects, but prohibitive in time and money for anything bigger than your fist. As an exercise, during the presentation, we had to represent a croassant in a parametrical way. We could draw it by hand, digitally or directly on Miro. I drew it by hand quickly without thinking too much. Task 2: Testing with Blender For the exercise of this class we must use one of these tools presented to put into practice. I chose Blender because I have never used it and because there are a variety of options to create the object, such as, lighting, rendering, animation and creation of three-dimensional graphics. I have used an internet tutor to guide me step by step and I have realized that all the tools I have used in my past, such as Cinema 4D, are very similar but different at the same time. Each uses a different language and learning a new language is usually not easy at first. I really liked the program but I still have to put it into practice more to get better results. AI render in Blender 2D Fabrication \u00b6 08/02/2023 This week we have been introduced to the laser cutter. In my past I had already used it but this session has been good for me to refresh my knowledge.In the image shown below was my first object that I created with the laser cutter, allowing to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the class. Benefits of Laser cutting for prototyping This tool offer a high level of precision, accuracy and speed, making it possible to quickly create complex shapes and designs with ease. One of the main benefits of using a laser cutter for prototyping is the ability to quickly produce accurate and high-quality prototypes. With a laser cutter, it is possible to create intricate designs and shapes with precise dimensions and clean edges, which can greatly improve the overall quality of the final product. Another advantage of using a laser cutter for prototyping is the ability to work with a wide range of materials. From wood and acrylic to metals and textiles, laser cutters can work with a wide range of materials, making it possible to produce prototypes that closely resemble the final product. Task 3: Using the lasercut To put theory into practice we were to use a method to Laser cut something. Currently, I am in a project where we are experimenting with biomaterials. I have taken this opportunity to create molds for the development of this project. Next, I show step by step the process for the creation of these molds with the laser cutter. LaserCut steps de June Bascaran Bilbao Inputs & outputs \u00b6 09/02/2023 The second part of the week we learned about inputs and outputs, looking at different sensors, what they can do and how. Sensors play a critical role in a wide range of applications and are essential for many modern technologies. For example, automation, robotics, healthcare, environmental monitoring or smart homes. They are used to gather data about the physical world and convert that information into electrical signals that can be processed and analyzed by computer systems. Task 4: Testing sensors with Arduino As an excercise we tryed to use a sensor and actuator to comunicate, using a simple Light Dependant Resistor (LDR) and a LED. To perform this exercise more easily, we did it in parts. First, we tried turning on the LED with a button. To do this, we use a code provided by Arduino IDE, in which, you only have to change the number of the Pin. After this part worked, we tested the LDR with another board. Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) acts as a light sensor that can detect changes in light intensity and adjust the circuit accordingly. MICROCHALLENGE I \u00b6 14/02/2023 - 17/02/2023 For this first challenge, I teamed up with Paige and Sami since we are in the same proyect and all three of us are interested in experimenting with biomaterials. The goals for this Challenge were to apply the things learnt during the past weeks in Prototyping for design: electronics and couding, 2D and 3D modelling, laser-cut and vinyl cut. After experimenting with many materials, we realized that we needed to develop molds for our future projects. We took this opportunity to develop a bio presser that would allow us to shape the final product. To do this, we defined the following variables: a low-tech bio presser for non-sticky biomaterials, interchangeable molds, and consistent pressure. The most challenging part of this bio presser was making it interchangeable with other molds so that we could shape the material in different ways. Our plan then was to create a flatter mold that could produce three simple, blob-like modular plates. We started the project by brainstorming ideas and drawing sketches. At first, we thought that developing this project would be easy, but soon we realized that it was more complicated than we expected. It was important to consider many variables, such as ventilation holes, the mold material, and the shape of the plates. We modeled the mold using Illustrator and Rhino software so that we could cut it using a laser cutter. We created a variety of prototypes to bring our ideas to reality. This helped us a lot in identifying future problems with the mold. The idea behind this project was to create a bio presser that could make it easier to develop our future projects. I would have liked to create a mold that would allow us to interchange different shapes. It would also have been interesting to include a moisture sensor or a timer device. In conclusion, this mold could be improved in the future to create other products with different shapes, and it could be a tool that is available to anyone interested in experimenting with biomaterials and creating their products in a simple and straightforward way. For the next challenge, I would like to approach the project differently, perhaps not so technically focused, and more geared towards creating a tool or prototype that facilitates interaction between the user and the product.

Functioning as an interlinked web of devices, networks facilitate the seamless exchange of information through various communication channels. What is a network? A network is a collection of devices, such as computers, printers, and smartphones, that are connected to each other using some form of communication technology, like wires, cables, or wireless signals. These devices can communicate with each other and share information, resources, and services, which can be useful in a variety of contexts, from homes and offices to large corporations and the internet itself. Task 5: Connecting Arduino to wifi server 3D fabrication & scanning \u00b6 23/02/2023 This week\u2019s topic of FabAcademy was 3D printing and scanning. During the theoretical class, the FabLab team explained a bit the story of 3D printing, starting from the first SLA printers and the RepRap project until nowadays where there are 3D printers for literally everything. They also explained the functioning of the main 3D printing technologies and the materials that are normally used in each of them. Then, we were told about how to slice a 3D modelled part to have the optimal result. Many parameters have a direct effect on the final printed part such as layer height, infill, directionality, shell, etc. It\u2019s necessary to set a proper configuration for each part, using a slicing program like Cura. For that, you need to have the part in a mesh format that can be STL, OBJ or 3MF generally. Preferably, STL. After the 3d printing introduction, it was the turn for 3D scanning. FabLab team procceded to show us some ways to scan using diverse programs and methods. This session has been of great interest to me. I think that 3D printers has revolutionized the way we see product design. One of the most exciting developments in 3D printing is the increasing availability of high-quality. As these printers become more widely available, designers will have even greater flexibility in their designs and will be able to produce complex shapes and structures with ease. Also, the wide range of materials that can be use in this technologies is a very important factor for the work of designers. Task 5: 3D printing & scanning PART 1 | 3D PRINTING: For the practical exercise of this session we need to print using 3D printer and then scan it. To do this, I started by creating the model in Blender and then saved it in STL. I created a candle plate in which it will create a visual effect with the shadows while the candle is consumed. Then, transfer the file to the Cura program and change the parameters necessary for printing, such the infill,speed, supports and temperature. Once we have all these parameters correct, we preview the printing process and send it to the card. Then this card is placed on the machine. We look for our file and give it to PRINT. The organic shapes of this object need many supports to be manufactured. This will damage the final texture of the object, but it can be fixed by sanding it. Copia de LaserCut steps de June Bascaran Bilbao PART 2 | 3D SCANNING: Interfaces - machine interactions \u00b6 01/03/2023 In this class we have been working with Arduino, trying to turn on a LED in different ways: The hardcoded way (Exercise 1) Asking for it (Exercise 2) Making it do animations (Exercise 3) Asking for it from the internet (Exercise 4 and 5) Making sensors do it remotely (Exercise 6) Exercise 1: The hardcoded way For this exercise we use the code that Arduino provide, called Blink. The only thing that we have to change is the pin number. Exercise 2: Asking for it For this one, we changue the code to be able to write \u201cblink\u201d in the monitor and the Led makes the funtion. Exercise 3: Making do animations We install the library Jled to have new funtions for the Led, such us, breathe, candle, fade on, fade off, etc. Exercise 4 and 5: Asking for it from the internet In this case, we are going to ask to turn on the Led trough online network. To do this, we create a code that allows you to connect to a Wi-Fi network. In this way, we can control the parameters of the Led from the internet. (Exercise 5): After getting it we also add a new function for the Led, in my case, candle mode. Exercise 6: Making sensors do it remotely CNC \u00b6 02/03/2023 During our recent class, we delved into the benefits of utilizing CNC technology, explored the intricacies of its workings, and even had a chance to witness a live demonstration of how Rhino CAM can be used to set up a file and simulate the process. CNC technology has been around for quite some time and has proven to be a reliable choice for subtractive processes. Its key advantage lies in the consistent and accurate results it can deliver, thanks to the ability to control the material through a variety of milling bits. Unlike laser cutting, CNC milling bits create fillets instead of sharp corners, which can be beneficial for press-fitting materials together. To address this difference, there are options such as Dog Bone or T-Bone cuts that provide enough overlap and a strong connection for press fitting materials together. To put this class in practise we cut a wood handheld sieve, where the net size and texture can be changed. S T E P S S T E P \u00b7 1 We drew the 3D model in Rhino in different variations to test size and form. We tested these parametres parallel with cutting simple pieces in cardboard to assure that the size would be appropriate to hold with one hand, that the length and that the width of the handle is good for a holding. We chose to proceed with a more square shaped model that has more space to sieve. S T E P \u00b7 2 Thereafter the Rhino.3dm file is to be processed to CNC cut. Depending on the CNC macine used there are different ways to process the file. In this case we are using a \u2026 First choose all curves that will be cut (profiles) and carved(\u2026) and Make 2d. S T E P \u00b7 3 Choose which drill you want to use, where we in this case we used a 6mm downcut drill. We then set the parametres of speed and how much it will cut for every layer for the material used - 15 mm Plywood. S T E P \u00b7 4 First add points around the curves that will be cut for marking the material to screw it tightly to the table. Second, choose the curves that will be \u2018carved\u2019 and set parametres for depth and if cutting inside or outside of the curve. Third choose curves within the form that will be profiled and set the parametres, here adding add ons so it keeps the material in place after being cut. Forth choose the curves that are the outlines of the form, here we set the same parametres for profiling and again adding add ons. S T E P \u00b7 5 Test run the cutting path in the program to make sure it runs smoothly. We could here see that we could have problems with the sides being quite thin, where by cutting against the wood grain, there might be big splinters. As this is a prototype for testing it is not an issue, but for a good finish this would have to be considered in the design. STEP \u00b7 6 To set up the CNC, first place the material and set your \u2018home\u2019 by moving the x & Y axis to the very point of the material. Then set the Z axis by using the magnet assigned to the machine. S T E P \u00b7 7 Import the CNC files made and start with adding marks for the screws. When this is done, move the CNC away from the material and screw the material to the table in the marks that have been made. Therafter start your file for \u2026 and profiling. Stay with the machine until it is finished to make sure it cuts correctly and nothing goes wrong. S T E P \u00b7 8 When finished, move the CNC machine away from the material. Use a vacuum or airpressure to blow away the sawdust from the cuts made and check so it has cut through all the way. In this case it had and we removed the material from the table and cleaned the machine. S T E P \u00b7 9 The parts were a bit rough on the edges and needed some sanding to clean them off. Therafter the top part was laser cut. S T E P \u00b7 10 To assemble, use the front lasercut part as a guide to cut the size of net that is preferred and cut around it. Place the cut out net into the bottom part and press it in place with the top. Right now the parts fit together and hold in place, if this form and tool works well when tested together with Clean Beach Initiative we will have to work on how tey will be attached with eachother. MICROCHALLENGE II \u00b6 14/03/2023 - 17/03/2023 Sami Piercy \u00b7 Josephine Bourghardt \u00b7 June Bascaran For this Micro Challenge we have been working with creating tools for part of a Beach Cleaning Kit. CONCEPT For the past months we have been volunteering with the organisation Clean Beach Intiative. They organise weekly beach cleaning sessions every Staurday at Barceloneta. Through this experience we realised the amount of micro plastics, and the difficulty to collect them with the tools provided. We have therfor been experimenting and testing different nets and tools to collect these small pieces more efficiently. Everything that is collected during the session is later sorted and weighed to be recycled. All the very small pieces take too long to sort from all the bags and are therefor thrown in the normal trash. We want to create tools to collect and sort these smaller pieces. We would also like to be able to weigh them in the same way that the other waste is to communicate the amount of microplastics that are collected during this one hour session. PURPOSE Portable & Stackable collecting and sorting trays Handheld microplastic siv Sorting divider for collection bag Link to our hackmd to read about the full process: https://hackmd.io/@Kgea_wTSQ1i-eiGs2APlag/HJU8UUAJn PERSONAL REFLECTION During the second Micro Challenge, our objective was to design and develop tools that would be beneficial for Clean Beach Initiatives. As a team that has volunteered together for some time, we had already tested some tools and had a more defined plan for the challenge. We brought the tools we created to the organized Beach Clean and allowed the volunteers to try them out. The feedback we received was valuable, particularly in terms of the tools\u2019 form and function. Based on this feedback, we plan to make changes to the hand sieve to make it more effective in digging through sand. Overall, the tools proved useful and have potential for further refinement. This challengue for me has been more. I am happy with the final result of the artifact, I think this prototype clearly defines what the design process really is, where the user is involved in this process and the designers can collect that valuable information in the first person. I really enjoyed putting my electronic skills for this project, although sometimes I get very frustrated I think victory is more valuable than all that.","title":"Prototyping for design"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20design/#prototyping-for-design","text":"This section will be part of a weekly journal where I\u2019ll be documenting what we are doing during the course Prototyping for Design.

To creating music with Arduino and buzzers we used a ESP32 microcontroller, a piezo buzzer that is an electronic component that can make sounds, a bread board and connection wires and pins which are then connected through Arduino IDE and code to make sounds. Even though this topic is difficult for me to work with, there are a lot of online tutorias to make it easy.

We started off by communally adding programs we have worked with in the past to a Miroboard. I have used 2D and 3D programs for modelling before such as Illustrator, Rhino, Solidworks, NX, Cinema 4D to create 3D and 2D models and files for digital manufacturing. Also, I saw so many interesting programs and other ways of working. In relation to the development of my future projects I am interested in using the following tools: Womp 3D: Womp is a 3D software company that makes it simple for users to bring their 3D ideas to life. Womp\u2019s support for social and collaboration features, which encourages users to learn from one another, improve their 3D design skills, and share their works. Adobe Illustraitor: Adobe Illustrator (AI) is a vector graphics editor used for editing, among other things (illustration as a branch of digital art applied to technical illustration or graphic design, among others). Thingiverse: Thingiverse is a website dedicated to the sharing of user-created digital design files. Providing primarily free, open-source hardware designs licensed. 3D printers, laser cutters, milling machines and many other technologies can be used to physically create the files shared by the users on Thingiverse. Blender: is a cross-platform computer program, dedicated especially to modeling, lighting, rendering, animation and creation of three-dimensional graphics. Also digital composition using the node procedural technique, video editing, sculpture (includes dynamic topology) and digital painting. FlatFab: flatfab is software that helps you design and fabricate 3D objects. 3D printing in new-age materials is great for small complex objects, but prohibitive in time and money for anything bigger than your fist. As an exercise, during the presentation, we had to represent a croassant in a parametrical way. We could draw it by hand, digitally or directly on Miro. I drew it by hand quickly without thinking too much. Task 2: Testing with Blender For the exercise of this class we must use one of these tools presented to put into practice. I chose Blender because I have never used it and because there are a variety of options to create the object, such as, lighting, rendering, animation and creation of three-dimensional graphics. I have used an internet tutor to guide me step by step and I have realized that all the tools I have used in my past, such as Cinema 4D, are very similar but different at the same time. Each uses a different language and learning a new language is usually not easy at first. I really liked the program but I still have to put it into practice more to get better results.

In my past I had already used it but this session has been good for me to refresh my knowledge.In the image shown below was my first object that I created with the laser cutter, allowing to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the class. Benefits of Laser cutting for prototyping This tool offer a high level of precision, accuracy and speed, making it possible to quickly create complex shapes and designs with ease. One of the main benefits of using a laser cutter for prototyping is the ability to quickly produce accurate and high-quality prototypes. With a laser cutter, it is possible to create intricate designs and shapes with precise dimensions and clean edges, which can greatly improve the overall quality of the final product. Another advantage of using a laser cutter for prototyping is the ability to work with a wide range of materials. From wood and acrylic to metals and textiles, laser cutters can work with a wide range of materials, making it possible to produce prototypes that closely resemble the final product. Task 3: Using the lasercut To put theory into practice we were to use a method to Laser cut something. Currently, I am in a project where we are experimenting with biomaterials. I have taken this opportunity to create molds for the development of this project. Next, I show step by step the process for the creation of these molds with the laser cutter.

Sensors play a critical role in a wide range of applications and are essential for many modern technologies. For example, automation, robotics, healthcare, environmental monitoring or smart homes. They are used to gather data about the physical world and convert that information into electrical signals that can be processed and analyzed by computer systems. Task 4: Testing sensors with Arduino As an excercise we tryed to use a sensor and actuator to comunicate, using a simple Light Dependant Resistor (LDR) and a LED. To perform this exercise more easily, we did it in parts. First, we tried turning on the LED with a button. To do this, we use a code provided by Arduino IDE, in which, you only have to change the number of the Pin. After this part worked, we tested the LDR with another board. Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) acts as a light sensor that can detect changes in light intensity and adjust the circuit accordingly.","title":"Inputs &amp; outputs"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20design/#microchallenge-i","text":"14/02/2023 - 17/02/2023 For this first challenge, I teamed up with Paige and Sami since we are in the same proyect and all three of us are interested in experimenting with biomaterials. The goals for this Challenge were to apply the things learnt during the past weeks in Prototyping for design: electronics and couding, 2D and 3D modelling, laser-cut and vinyl cut. After experimenting with many materials, we realized that we needed to develop molds for our future projects. We took this opportunity to develop a bio presser that would allow us to shape the final product. To do this, we defined the following variables: a low-tech bio presser for non-sticky biomaterials, interchangeable molds, and consistent pressure. The most challenging part of this bio presser was making it interchangeable with other molds so that we could shape the material in different ways. Our plan then was to create a flatter mold that could produce three simple, blob-like modular plates. We started the project by brainstorming ideas and drawing sketches.

Design is the attitude we have towards the simple things of everyday life, to the more transcendental ones that we believe transform our lives or other people\u2019s lives forever. The meaning and purpose in design are personal perceptions that translate into actions, but it also needs to be a collective effort in order to synchronize interventions at multiple scales that will allow the human species to inhabit and coexist on this planet with other forms of life, which are needed to sustain human life itself. Tomas Diez Abstract \u00b6 The interconnectedness between people and their social and physical environments, as well as humanity and the earth, has been largely forgotten in our modern culture. We tend to view things in a linear way, consuming and disposing of them without considering the impact on our surroundings. Businesses prioritize profit and productivity, whereas nature operates on a cyclical basis. When something is discarded in nature, it is recycled and repurposed, contributing to the flourishing of other organisms. The natural world functions as a harmonious system, with every species playing a role in maintaining balance. The key to a sustainable future lies in reconciling our industrial society with the natural world, and recognizing the importance of both in achieving a harmonious coexistence. Design has the potential to offer us more than just a functional and aesthetically pleasing product or environment. It can serve as a gateway to a broader perception of the world, connecting us to a larger reality. For a design to effectively resonate with us, it must meet several criteria. It must serve a specific purpose, evoke an emotional response, and align with our cultural style. By meeting these standards, a design can become an extension of our identity. However, it is also essential that a design is rooted in a belief system that we can identify with and has a purpose that we can empathize with to connect us effectively with the rest of the world. Whether it is urban design, product design, or the design of our own lives, design can serve as a bridge to a more profound connection with ourselves and the world around us. On the other hand, it is possible to create a different kind of system that prioritizes the well-being of both people and the planet. This involves designing goods, urban landscapes, and processes with a purpose that benefits the many rather than the few. By including notions such as function, emotion, culture, and belief, design can become a transformational force that not only benefits the present but also future generations. The challenge is to develop a new belief system that recognizes the interconnectedness of all living things and prioritizes sustainability and social justice. If we can create a new design paradigm that aligns with these values, we may be able to build a more just and equitable society that works in harmony with the natural world. The impact of modern design. \u00b6 As humans, we have made tremendous technological advancements that have undoubtedly made our lives easier and more comfortable. However, we often fail to consider the potential negative consequences of our actions. One of the most significant negative impacts of modern design is the overconsumption of resources. Modern design often encourages consumerism and a culture of disposable products, which leads to the overproduction of goods and the depletion of natural resources. The trend towards fast fashion, for example, results in the production of large amounts of clothing that are often discarded after a few uses, contributing to the overconsumption of materials and energy. Furthermore, modern design often leads to the creation of waste. The production of modern design products often involves the use of non-renewable resources, high energy consumption, and the generation of waste and pollution. The use of synthetic materials and chemicals in modern design can also lead to environmental harm, such as water and air pollution and the destruction of ecosystems. Moreover, modern design can contribute to the loss of cultural and historical heritage. The widespread availability of modern design products and the prevalence of social media has created a globalized design language that often disregards local traditions and cultural context. This can result in a loss of cultural identity and a sense of place, as well as the erosion of traditional crafts and skills that have been passed down from generation to generation. Design as a tool of change. \u00b6 One may contend that designing for sustainability presents a paradox, as the very act of creating goods often involves depleting natural resources that we strive to conserve. Thus, designers must adopt a reverse approach, carefully considering how to achieve the desired outcome using locally sourced, renewable, recycled, or biodegradable materials. Equally important is minimizing waste by implementing practices like reusability and upcycling. Design plays a crucial role in imbuing objects fashioned from limited resources with significance and value. Whether tackling urbanisation, renewable energy, or waste reduction, designers are at the forefront of driving change. Design for sustainability involves an approach to activities that prioritizes the well-being of both people and the environment as the ultimate objective. It involves creating products and methods that are resource-efficient and use environmentally friendly materials. Often referred to as lifecycle design, this method considers a product\u2019s entire lifespan, including its impact on living beings and the environment. The growing consumer and industry focus on sustainability has popularized the design for sustainability approach, particularly for new product and process development. While contemporary designers strive to prioritize sustainability in their work, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that our predecessors were more likely to follow trends and established design schools of thought than to prioritize ecological concerns. Today, we benefit from years of research into materials and processes that have made sustainable practices more accessible. These practices have expanded beyond design into other areas of an organization, where consideration for the entire product lifecycle was previously absent Conclusion \u00b6 The field of design presents a powerful opportunity to enact meaningful change in the world. By prioritizing sustainability and social welfare, designers can create solutions that not only benefit local communities but can also be scaled up to have a global impact. As design becomes more accessible thanks to the spread of information, locally developed innovations can contribute to the growing pool of knowledge that is shaping our collective future. Through reflection on our past mistakes, both as an industry and as a society, designers have shifted their values to prioritize a harmonious relationship with the natural world and future generations. This means creating solutions that align with our belief systems and empathize with the needs of diverse communities. By incorporating a wide range of perspectives, we can ensure that everyone is represented and that we can grow and thrive together without sacrificing the wellbeing of our planet.","title":"Making sense & meaning"},{"location":"term2/04-Making%20sense%20%26%20meaning/#making-sense-and-meaning","text":"12/03/2023 It might be hard to accept that humans have full responsibility for the current climate emergency and social imbalances, but we have designed all of it.

Personal Reflection \u00b6 The distributed design approach has the potential to have a significant impact in the future, as it offers a more collaborative and inclusive way of addressing the complex and changing challenges facing the world today. One of the main benefits of distributed design is that it encourages the participation and inclusion of different actors and communities in the design process, which can lead to more relevant and sustainable solutions. By involving different perspectives and skills, more innovative and effective solutions for complex problems can be found. Additionally, the focus on regeneration and sustainability in distributed design can have long-term benefits for the environment and society as a whole. Distributed design can also contribute to the creation of stronger and more connected communities, by fostering collaboration and active participation in the design process. This can lead to greater social cohesion and a stronger sense of community belonging. With the growing automation and digitalization of production, the question arises whether there will be designers in the future or whether anyone can produce whatever they want whenever they want. The role of the designer is evolving and transforming. Increasingly, designers are adopting a more collaborative and inclusive approach in their work, working closely with other professionals and communities to create more relevant and sustainable solutions. However, I think that in the future the role of design will continue to be an important role in creating innovative and effective solutions.","title":"Distributed Design"},{"location":"term3/02-Distributed%20design/#distributed-design","text":"","title":"Distributed Design"},{"location":"term3/02-Distributed%20design/#reflection-1-mushroom-model","text":"","title":"Reflection 1: Mushroom Model"},{"location":"term3/02-Distributed%20design/#learning-skills","text":"","title":"Learning skills"},{"location":"term3/02-Distributed%20design/#dynamics","text":"","title":"Dynamics"},{"location":"term3/02-Distributed%20design/#interactions","text":"","title":"Interactions"},{"location":"term3/02-Distributed%20design/#reflection-2-reflection-tree","text":"For the reflection tree I have chosen one of my projects from last semester to reflect on what I can improve.
