According to the methodology used in the design projects, the prototyping phase is carried out after the analysis and research phases (market analysis, user analysis, concept research, state of the art\u2026), conceptualization phase (ideation phase), product development (measurements, materials, 3D modeling, rendering\u2026). Consequently, not much has been delved into the subject. The only time I have made prototypes has been to analyze and explore the ergonomics of the product. As a tool to identify future functional problems. Thus, of the 4 prototyping roles I have used Role 1: Prototyping as an experimental component. As for the question of what prototyping role I would like to use in relation to my fight, my vision and my desire for professional identity, I am interested in using Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry , as a tool of empathy and Role 4: The prototyping process as a research vehicle . The latter could be a good method for the research and development of new sustainable materials, where the main objective is to analyze and explore how the product is crafted. In addition to these two Roles, I would also like to explore more in Role 1 , which I firmly believe that is a fundamental method for any product with a good aesthetic and functional design.

WHY? \u00b6 It all started in the first industrial revolution, where factories began to increase production. In this way, the price of the products decreased and thus, a greater population was able to acquire those products, improving people\u00b4s quality of live. But what is about the environment? The toxic gases emitted by the factories have generated global warming, and consequently, climate change. This environmental impact brings with it serious environmental problems, such as rising temperatures, floods, the loss of biodiversity or more poverty and inequality. HOW? \u00b6 The path towards a sustainable or even a regenerative future will demand that we abandon our current linear, extractive, and often toxic practices and remplance them with bio-based and renewable materials and circular methods. Design with bio-based and biomaterials can offer a host of benefits both for the nature and humans. A shift towards regenerative bio-based practices offers us a new mean to design sustainably and a framework for a deeper understanding and clearer awareness of the critical balance between our demand for things and the ecosystemic health of terretrial soils, water, and biological communities with whom we share our planet.

This card proposes to design collaboratively with nature, bringing us closer to a future where what is made by humans and the growth of nature becomes one. It is about stopping consuming nature as a geological resource to nourishing it as biological. From here arises my interest in new ecological materials or biomaterials that will improve the impact generated by current consumerism and also the communication between humans and nature as an emotional and artistic act through materials. Questions to solve: How can humans collaborate with other species to create new materials without depleting natural resources? Rural futures: My interest in this card comes from my roots, the place where I grew up, a small coastal town in the Basque Country. This place stands out for its history, culture and tradition. It is a land historically linked to txakoli (a type of Basque wine) and currently remains one of the municipalities with the largest number of wineries in Biscay. It is also a place attracted touristically by its beach and the surfing. I firmly believe that to generate a positive impact on our environment globally we must start with the resources we have and reflect on how they can be used. Development for a rural future is for me an opportunity to start projects where the main objective is to unite the rural community to collaborate in the care and well-being of rural areas, activities where themes such as socialization, leisure, tradition and care for the environment predominate. I imagine a rural future where urban centers, rural jobs, tourism and the green economy are revitalized. A place where new opportunities are provided through new technologies. A more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable rural future. Craft and digital fabrications: The aim of this letter is to unite modern processes such as digital fabrication with artisanal manufacturing processes, reshaping innovation towards a new definition of slower manufacturing. Establishing a new aesthetic driven by sustainability, functionality and craft. Questions to solve: How can we switch to slowed processes to start producing to large scales? AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY \u00b6 Reshape natural resources; explore raw materials. Materials have an active role in design, creating form and expression, not just fulfilling technical requirements. Empathize with other living species and be conscious of their life cycle. Encourage craft skills (gardening, ceramics, glass process).

It offers a wide assortment of varieties with different shapes and colors, but the taste has changed. The tomato no longer tastes like tomato. This is due to a change in the genetics of the fruit, which has been modified to increase the productivity of the plant (size and quantity of the fruit) and not to increase or improve the taste of the tomato. But, how is the genetics of a tomato manipulated? This process is carried out by modifying the structure of the DNA contained in the cells of the organism, copying, deleting, inserting or moving long sequences from one point to another in the genome (total sequence of DNA possessed by a particular organism). To increase the size of the tomato, copies of the gene that determines the size of the fruit are increased. In this way, the production of the same is increased. And, how can the original taste be returned to the tomato? Several studies have identified a genetic code responsible for 13 chemical compounds associated with flavor, which abound in ancestral tomato varieties. Using a new technique called CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) you can cut (ctrl X) and paste (ctrl V) various DNA sequences so that the tomato grows with the genetic properties of ancestral tomatoes. New 2 : Why scientist want to help plants capture more carbon dioxide. \u00b6 The most effective and amazing carbon removal technology is photosynthesis. Plants use sunlight as energy and they pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, they turn it into a carbon fuel and that\u2019s how they grow. The 40% of that carbon fuel, they send down to their roots. They\u2019re leaking it out in a very strategic way to soil microorganisms. Plants are feeding soil microorganisms carbon, and the soil microorganisms are bringing plants mineral nutrients. In the process of all that, those soil microorganisms make a carbon glue out of that carbon fuel and they make habitat in the soil. They make little pockets in the soil to control the flow of air and water. That\u2019s one of the ways that carbon gets fixed in the soil. In other words, soil has the unique ability to sequester carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Soil, plants and climate are connected. If we don\u2019t have a living plant, we\u2019re going to have more evaporation. What we want is transpiration, when the moisture leaves through the plant increases humidity and, consequently, we have more rain. We should take advantage of the regenerative capacity of the soil.
