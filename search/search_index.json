According to the methodology used in the design projects, the prototyping phase is carried out after the analysis and research phases (market analysis, user analysis, concept research, state of the art\u2026), conceptualization phase (ideation phase), product development (measurements, materials, 3D modeling, rendering\u2026). Consequently, not much has been delved into the subject. The only time I have made prototypes has been to analyze and explore the ergonomics of the product. As a tool to identify future functional problems. Thus, I have used Role 1: Prototype as a experimental component As for the question of what prototyping role I would like to use in relation to my fight, my vision and my desire for professional identity, I am interested in using Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry , as a tool of empathy and Role 4: The prototyping process as a research vehicle . The latter could be a good method for the research and development of new sustainable materials, where the main objective is to analyze and explore how the product is crafted. In addition to these two Roles, I would also like to explore more in Role 1 , which I firmly believe that is a fundamental method for any product with a good aesthetic and functional design.

A journey where I have planted seeds in topics that I have always had interest in. A journey where I have learned that many times the best way to get out mental kaos and fear is by doing. Coming out of a professional past where I worked hours and hours between four walls, this first experience in the master\u2019s has allowed me to understand that design is much more than creating aesthetic, ergonomic and marketable products. It has helped me to face the professional reality in a more solidary way, leaving my comfort zone and collaborating with communities in the city. After this first intervention I have understood that part of the current problem of consumerism is based on the perception that people have with the objects they use in their day to day. A psychological, cultural, or social behavior in which affection and value about the things around us has been lost. If we look back and analyze the behavior that our ancestors had with their goods, we can highlight that they had other perceptions about the value of things. When something didn\u2019t work, they fixed it or reused it for other functions. Currently, we live in a system where we are continuously driven to buy, without even stopping to think if we really need it. A false abundance, where we tend to measure our wealth based on the things we own and not the use we give it. I really believe that materials have an important role to convey emotions and values in the final artifact. In term II, I would like to explore the emotions that are elicited in the encounter between humans, materials and the context in which they operate. Considering the increase in the use of new materials and the consequent deple-tion of natural resources. Creating a sensorial and interactive experience with materials.

It offers a wide assortment of varieties with different shapes and colors, but the taste has changed. The tomato no longer tastes like tomato. This is due to a change in the genetics of the fruit, which has been modified to increase the productivity of the plant (size and quantity of the fruit) and not to increase or improve the taste of the tomato. But, how is the genetics of a tomato manipulated? This process is carried out by modifying the structure of the DNA contained in the cells of the organism, copying, deleting, inserting or moving long sequences from one point to another in the genome (total sequence of DNA possessed by a particular organism). To increase the size of the tomato, copies of the gene that determines the size of the fruit are increased. In this way, the production of the same is increased. And, how can the original taste be returned to the tomato? Several studies have identified a genetic code responsible for 13 chemical compounds associated with flavor, which abound in ancestral tomato varieties. Using a new technique called CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) you can cut (ctrl X) and paste (ctrl V) various DNA sequences so that the tomato grows with the genetic properties of ancestral tomatoes. New 2 : Why scientist want to help plants capture more carbon dioxide. \u00b6 The most effective and amazing carbon removal technology is photosynthesis.

The 40% of that carbon fuel, they send down to their roots. They\u2019re leaking it out in a very strategic way to soil microorganisms. Plants are feeding soil microorganisms carbon, and the soil microorganisms are bringing plants mineral nutrients. In the process of all that, those soil microorganisms make a carbon glue out of that carbon fuel and they make habitat in the soil. They make little pockets in the soil to control the flow of air and water. That\u2019s one of the ways that carbon gets fixed in the soil. In other words, soil has the unique ability to sequester carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Soil, plants and climate are connected. If we don\u2019t have a living plant, we\u2019re going to have more evaporation.

Thanks to this program has helped me understand that the current system in which we live is only motivated by economic reasons, sell and consume more. In this way, they create products that after a period of time, calculated in advance by the manufacturer or company, stop working and are irreparable. The electrical components are hidden inside a black box, apparently difficult to obtain and understand. Once this barrier is crossed you understand that the technology used to operate the machine is not as complicated as it seemed and even those electrical components could be used for other purposes or replaced by others without the need to buy a new product. DRIP COFFEE POT UNPACKING \u00b6 What surprised me? The technological design of this coffee machine seems at first complex. But it actually uses very simple operating systems. The use of Low-Tech sistems: water level metric scale, coffee dripper (from the filter to the kettle). When we first saw the machine (big plastic case) we thought that the electrical components would occupy more space, it turns out it doesn\u2019t require so much plastic. It was surprising to find so much plastic material to store so few electrical components: thermostat, heater, board and button + LED. Smart materials is using material properties to our advantage as designers. Use of metal components, without any functional purpose, to give the product a more elegant and quality appearance. ALMOST USELESS MACHINE \u00b6 The second week of the Tech Beyond the Mith program we had a workshop called \u201cAlmost Useless Machine\u201d. Through this program I have understood that through a basic knowledge of electronics you can create machines or very interesting objects. BUBBLE MACHINE \u00b6 From Tuesday to Friday my group and I have been working on a bubble machine. This machine arises from the idea that technology is not always synonymous with comfort and ease, which is often the opposite. For this we have designed a system that simulates the same actions as when the bubbles are blown manually (the lid is opened and the stick is removed from the container). The result: 10 hours a day of work in a loop of failures and hits to finally create a bubble machine.

Once this barrier is crossed you understand that the technology used to operate the machine is not as complicated as it seemed and even those electrical components could be used for other purposes or replaced by others without the need to buy a new product.","title":"Tech Beyond the Mith"},{"location":"term1/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Mith/#drip-coffee-pot-unpacking","text":"What surprised me? The technological design of this coffee machine seems at first complex. But it actually uses very simple operating systems. The use of Low-Tech sistems: water level metric scale, coffee dripper (from the filter to the kettle). When we first saw the machine (big plastic case) we thought that the electrical components would occupy more space, it turns out it doesn\u2019t require so much plastic. It was surprising to find so much plastic material to store so few electrical components: thermostat, heater, board and button + LED. Smart materials is using material properties to our advantage as designers. Use of metal components, without any functional purpose, to give the product a more elegant and quality appearance.","title":"DRIP COFFEE POT UNPACKING"},{"location":"term1/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Mith/#almost-useless-machine","text":"The second week of the Tech Beyond the Mith program we had a workshop called \u201cAlmost Useless Machine\u201d.

This machine arises from the idea that technology is not always synonymous with comfort and ease, which is often the opposite. For this we have designed a system that simulates the same actions as when the bubbles are blown manually (the lid is opened and the stick is removed from the container). The result: 10 hours a day of work in a loop of failures and hits to finally create a bubble machine.

We learned about the development of the practice of design throughout the past century, and how it has evolved into what it is nowadays, focusing on strategic design intervening in the natural environment. The vision of design has changed and now the world is asking for a more collaborative ways of working, instead of more individualistic ways, which only attends to achieve personal future desires. This change will allow us to face the challenges that the new reality is forcing upon us.

Hypothesizing about what is going to happen in the next one billion seconds. This course carried by Andres Calamaru has been a great chance to ask ourselves questions on how we would like to live 30 years from now. These reflections have been good to project my future and have helped me to have a more critical view of my time, how I spend it and how I would like to spend it. From the lesson one I extracted this three reflections: We can not save the world but we can take care of it. Currently, there is great pressure on young people due to the concern that exists for the environmental emergency. It is believed that young people have a responsibility to save this world, but I do not believe that it is about saving, it is about caring for and respecting our planet and all the living beings that take part in it. It\u2019s about making good decisions that help create a more ethical and responsible world. This reflection reminds me of something my mother always tells me: \u201cno hay que preocuparse, hay que ocuparse\u201d (no need to worry, you have to deal with it). From individualism to collaborative way of living. It is about seeing the system not vertically but horizontally, more egalitarian and supportive. I firmly believe that we are an interdependent society and that we need each other to live. A more collaborative world is for me a world that respects what is different, that favors more democratic decision-making. Designing for more solidary futures. It was interesting to think about different realities, imagining hopeful futures that will manage to face the current problems, writing a letter from myself in 2050 and others.

Lara began the session by introducing us to the projects she had been working on over the past few years. It was very inspiring to see all those solutions he proposes through biomaterials. Personally, I was very interested in the project \u201cBe grounded\u201d. A project that proposes to improve the relationship between humans and nature through materials, using an emotional and artistic language. Also, I liked all those projects that use food waste, especially the \u201cEn(des)uso\u201d project, which proposes various solutions to what we have always considered useless and invalid. I have to say that I was already aware of some of the projects presented, thanks to the intervention I made in Term 1 on food waste. Then, Lara briefly presented the history of materials and how they have influenced each era of the evolution of human beings, allowing us to improve our quality of life. Also, we contextualize the current problem of using materials as unlimited resources and the impact this is generating on the biosphere. On the other hand, he also emphasized that materials are more than their functionality and properties, they can also serve as tools to convey emotions, feelings and sensations. Proposing to the designers to select the materials to generate an interactive and sensory experience in the users. This area of exploration is of great interest to me. In my opinion, I think that there is currently a lack of value and affection for the materials that surround us, and therefore for the artifacts we use in our day. I firmly believe that materials can improve that relationship between people and objects. I also believe that the implementation of materials adding emotional values can help improve the life cycle of products, and consequently, the impact they have on the environment. Finally, we had the opportunity to experiment with biomaterials using food waste as addictive. In the case of our group, we use avocado skin to create bioplastic fibers.

Personally, I have found very interesting the use of the 3d printer with materials such as ceramics or biomaterials. In my past I had already used this technique for prototyping but never with those materials. I believe that the use of these innovative techniques are the future for product creation and development. I imagine a future where each person has these machines at home, such they have washing machines or microwaves, for the production of each product they need. The simple and intuitive use of these tools will allow anyone to make use of it. On the other hand, I also see it important to learn from ancient techniques such as modeling or casting. I believe that these techniques will remain with us forever, because of the properties and characteristics they bring to the final product.
