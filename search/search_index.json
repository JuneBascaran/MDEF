According to the methodology used in the design projects, the prototyping phase is carried out after the analysis and research phases (market analysis, user analysis, concept research, state of the art\u2026), conceptualization phase (ideation phase), product development (measurements, materials, 3D modeling, rendering\u2026). Consequently, not much has been delved into the subject. The only time I have made prototypes has been to analyze and explore the ergonomics of the product. As a tool to identify future functional problems. Thus, of the 4 prototyping roles I have used Role 1: Prototyping as an experimental component. As for the question of what prototyping role I would like to use in relation to my fight, my vision and my desire for professional identity, I am interested in using Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry , as a tool of empathy and Role 4: The prototyping process as a research vehicle . The latter could be a good method for the research and development of new sustainable materials, where the main objective is to analyze and explore how the product is crafted. In addition to these two Roles, I would also like to explore more in Role 1 , which I firmly believe that is a fundamental method for any product with a good aesthetic and functional design.

It offers a wide assortment of varieties with different shapes and colors, but the taste has changed. The tomato no longer tastes like tomato. This is due to a change in the genetics of the fruit, which has been modified to increase the productivity of the plant (size and quantity of the fruit) and not to increase or improve the taste of the tomato. But, how is the genetics of a tomato manipulated? This process is carried out by modifying the structure of the DNA contained in the cells of the organism, copying, deleting, inserting or moving long sequences from one point to another in the genome (total sequence of DNA possessed by a particular organism). To increase the size of the tomato, copies of the gene that determines the size of the fruit are increased. In this way, the production of the same is increased. And, how can the original taste be returned to the tomato? Several studies have identified a genetic code responsible for 13 chemical compounds associated with flavor, which abound in ancestral tomato varieties. Using a new technique called CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) you can cut (ctrl X) and paste (ctrl V) various DNA sequences so that the tomato grows with the genetic properties of ancestral tomatoes.

Plants are feeding soil microorganisms carbon, and the soil microorganisms are bringing plants mineral nutrients.

They make little pockets in the soil to control the flow of air and water. That\u2019s one of the ways that carbon gets fixed in the soil. In other words, soil has the unique ability to sequester carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Soil, plants and climate are connected. If we don\u2019t have a living plant, we\u2019re going to have more evaporation.

The objective of this seminar was to learn the basic concepts of AI and how it works. Also, learn through different tools the technology behind these complex machines. During this sessions, we have been arguing about what intelligence is and how that has been transferred in the current machines. Proposing ethical questions such as, could a machine make decisions for us? What would happen if they did? could they take control of our lives? Also, they gave us information of how Artificial Intelligence works and the main parts that make it up: dataset, neural network and training. There exist different neural networks for many different functions. In this few weeks working with IA, we have been texting with Google Colab, a free cloud service that facilitates the research of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence without having a neural network on your own computer.","title":"Extended Intelligences"},{"location":"term1/07-Extended%20Intelligence/#google-colab","text":"Thanks to this tool we have been able to work with some neural networks based on image classification, object recognition, motion detector and others. As an example, we used an AI to recognize different objects and for detect movements. Extended Intelligence de June Bascaran Bilbao These two sessions have allowed me to learn about fields I\u2019ve never explored before. It is interesting to know more about this type of technologies that today are so present in our day to day. Learning about the basics of this complex field opens up different opportunities for me to work on my next projects. Perhaps using AI, art and design. I would have liked to explore more with Google Colab and worked with more neural networks.","title":"Google Colab"}]}
